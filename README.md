This project tackles the inefficiencies of traditional 
unnumbered queueing systems, which cause prolonged waits 
and service delays, by introducing an automated, low-power, 
and priority-driven solution. Built around the AT89C51 
microcontroller, the system features a two-digit common anode 
7-segment display to show queue numbers (00â€“99) and an LED 
"SERVING" sign with a chasing-light effect for clear visual 
indication. 
The hardware utilizes ground (cathode) control for 
the 7-segment displays and LED sign, powered efficiently via 
an LM7812 voltage regulator. Queue numbers advance 
incrementally with a push-button trigger and reset to 00 via a 
secondary button, ensuring seamless operation. Designed for 
high-traffic government institutions, this system eliminates 
verbal callouts, reduces staff workload, and enhances client 
throughput. Its low-power design makes it cost-effective for 
continuous use, while the scalable architecture allows future 
upgrades like wireless integration or extended display ranges.
